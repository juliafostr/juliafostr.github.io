    <p>The internet has brought about as many sites as you can imagine. Below, I will describe some of my favorite sites to visit
    <br> when I am bored and wanting some fresh entertainment.</p>
    <h2><strong>FMLife.com</strong></h2>

    <p>I discovered this site during the Pandemic's push for doom scrolling and wasted time to get through quarentine.
The brutal honesty of these posts is often laughable, as well as relatable.
<br>There is a voting system that I dislike though, which has randoms decide if "You deserved it" and "I agree, your life sucks".</br></p>
    <p> Click the link <a href="https://www.fmylife.com/">FMLife.com</a> for an amusing scroll!</p>
    <h2><strong>Youtube.com</strong></h2>

    <p>The classic early 2,000s site to watch your favorite clips of ultimate fails, cute kitten videos, and of course, your funniest youtubers!
<br>There is also a voting system associated with youtube such as clicking "like" or "dislike".</br></p>
    <p> Click the link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q5aprqreSk&t=81s">youtube.com</a> for a plethora of entertainment.</p>
    <h2><strong>Wordle</strong></h2>

    <p>For a more "educating" way to waste time, check out this site. Wordle has daily word challenges that you can compete with frineds against!
      <br>I find it exciting and even compete with my mom occasionaly.<br></p>
