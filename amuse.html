    <h2>FMLife.com</h2>
    <p>I discovered this site during the Pandemic's push for doom scrolling and wasted time to get through quarentine.
The brutal honesty of these posts is often laughable, as well as relatable.
<br>There is a voting system that I dislike though, which has randoms decide if "You deserved it" and "I agree, your life sucks".</br></p>
    <p> Click the link <a href="https://www.fmylife.com/">FMLife.com</a> for an amusing scroll!</p>
    <h2>Youtube.com</h2>
    <p>The classic early 2,000s site to watch your favorite clips of ultimate fails, cute kitten videos, and of course, your funniest youtubers!
<br>There is also a voting system associated with youtube such as clicking "like" or "dislike".</br></p>
