      <p>Dwayne, <em>the rock</em> Johnson is a household name. The famous WWE fighter-turned actor has argued he owns the name, and recently bought the rights to the famous "the Rock" nickname. "Johnson, a movie and wrestling star, has a business portfolio that includes his production company Seven Bucks Productions, tequila brand Teremana Tequila, energy drink company ZOA Energy, Project Rock apparel brand and the United Football League."
