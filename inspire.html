      <p>Someone who inspires me is Madison Marsh. She is the <strong><em>2024 Miss America</em></strong> winner! The 22 year old active-duty air force officer is the first officer to ever compete in the competition. She is a very smart Harvard student who had her own foundation, <strong>the Whitney Marsh Foundation</strong> to fund pancreatic cancer research. 
     Mash inspires me to continually pursue my education and to always aim high. I’m excited to see where her career takes her! <strong><em></em>Who knows what she’ll achieve!</strong></p>
